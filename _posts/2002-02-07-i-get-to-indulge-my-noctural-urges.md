Thats right I get to go back to graveyard shifts for about two months
This is going to be very wierd, but I am not too worried.  I start Wed
night.  I will be putting in about 70+ hours this week.  I cleaned
my apartment for like 12 hours straight, on last friday night.
OK enough about that... ok one more thing.  It is only for 2 months.
Heh and I just turned down an offer for a Sr Security Consultant
job that would have been upwards of 120k sigh.
ok again I say on to a new subject: KungFu  I was able to slid out
early today and picked up the harddrive and got the entire class tonight
started out hard.  My throat started to close up and it was hard to
breathe for a bit.  I had to relaxe the throat.  I finally realize what
is needed.  To be really good, I will need to start working out for
strenght outside of the class and then just use the class for getting
the flow down.  ok.  I think I will add the new hard drive now.  wish me luck.

I am driving to a customer's site this morning and the rental car displays 21.  Cold indeed.  Not much going on this week, had a great <a target="_blank" title="2600" href="http://www.hou2600.org">2600</a> last friday.  Check out the meeting <a target="_blank" title="notes" href="http://www.hou2600.org/index.php/February2006">notes</a> to see what all happened.  I need to get my outstanding tickets taken care of this week.

This may look familiar, that's because it's what I posted last year about this time.  I still think it's an awesome charity, and highly recommend you check it out.

I am pretty certain most of my few readers know about Child's Play from my past posts or emails, if not it is a charity from the folks over at <a title="PA" href="http://www.penny-arcade.com">penny-arcade</a>. This is the fifth year and it's about that time, so I thought I would write my annual post about the great charity.

"Since 2003, over 100,000 gamers worldwide have banded together through Child’s Play, a community based charity grown and nurtured from the game culture and industry. Over two million dollars in donations of toys, games, books and cash for sick kids in children’s hospitals across North America and the world have been collected since our inception.

This year, we have continued expanding across the country and the globe. With over 45 partner hospitals and more arriving every month, you can be sure to find one from the map above that needs your help! You can choose to purchase requested items from their online retailer wish lists, or make a cash donation that helps out Child’s Play hospitals everywhere. Any items purchased through Amazon will be shipped directly to your hospital of choice, so please be sure to select their shipping address rather than your own."

It's pretty simple, you go to the site, click on a hospital ( I picked 2 last year, and am thinking 4 this year ), shop for some toys/books/dvd's whatever peaks your interest at amazon, and then purchase, and it is shipped to the child's hospital you picked earlier.

I can't describe to you how cool it feels.  I highly recommend you try it for yourself.

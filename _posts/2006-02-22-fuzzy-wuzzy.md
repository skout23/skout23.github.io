I am out of it this morning.  Overslept, heh polyphasic is not going to happen anytime soon.  I need to cut the caffeine, sugars, and late night eating before I can even begin to think about that.  I finished one of about four current projects for work last night, but then I remembered this morning that I forgot a section.  I hate that.

Re-spec'd my druid a few nights ago to feral + speed.  I love it for WSG.

Watched the ninth gate early Monday morning, was not as good as I remember.  I could have sworn that the abilities of the protagonist's sidekick came into question earlier on.  I don't think I can be less vague without giving too much away.  It got me interested again in "the club Dumas" again, which I believe I will put next on my "to be read"  list.

I need to clean this coming weekend, however I suspect that work will get in the way.  I have yet to catch up on sec going's on.  I just can't be bothered with it right now.

I need to help Shawn build a Baby's Website to share photo's with, hmmm might be a good baby present for J&amp;E.

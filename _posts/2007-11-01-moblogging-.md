So I jailbroke my iphone, added some neat tools.  One of which iflickr allows me to take pics and have them autoposted to flickr, and I have just setup flickr to allow it to post to my blog, so who knows I might just start blogging more about weird stuff I see.  Or what I am randomly doing now.  I will be talking at BarcampLA this weekend, LA2600 is this friday,  and a old friend will be in town this weekend.  So should be quite busy.  Will try to post about the talk, prius, my current obsessions, and other stuff.

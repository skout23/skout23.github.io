I have always found it hard to concentrate on one thing at a time.  In my haze of childhood I had Ritalin to rely on, however I don't have that available to me currently.  I have wondered if my usage of said "hyper-active" medicine might have lead to me becoming dependant on it.  However due to a relatively easy high school education, the need to focus was not required so my dependence went unnoticed.  I have in front of me at least 6 different sources that I need to digest and reformat to a more readable format for a customer, however I for the life of me can't seem to get started on just one.  My mind keeps on thinking about the other sections, which of course causes stress.  I think this is a great opportunity to start actively changing my neural pathways.  I know what I have to to, I have to build a plan of attack and then just execute one step at a time.  So I guess it's back to work for me.

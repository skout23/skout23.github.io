Why, cant I go to sleep like normal people?  I mean here i am it is
2:20am and I am not even close to tired.  People tell me they think i am
am sooo laid back and how cool that is.  I have this real since of
pressure in the back of my head at like all times.  It is very
hard to relax with it.  What is the pressure? i have no idea.

Man I find I really don’t like surprises. I got a call from a Mr Haynes
today at 4:37pm and he procedded to tell me that Colin was being held in
custody of the City. He is in the big house, and after running around I
also found out that there is more to the story. He had a prior warrent,
and is going to be going to the INS after he gets out of county. He was
just moved to county at about 12:45am. I am going to cancel the bond I
placed since INS will probly block any attempts for bail. It looks as if
he will be heading back to Singapore. I really hope not. more when i get
info…

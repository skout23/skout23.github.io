I know so bad, I can come up with all sorts of excuses, however it all boils down to it was not a priority, and I made other tasks take precedence.  Well that all changes today.  I have a wedding to attend in July, that I want to have a much better health for.  So workouts if not daily, I don't know how else to get it accomplished.  Diet is the key, so I may re-read BTFFTM.  Anyways workout went well I think for a first day back.  2.4 miles on the elliptical trainer, and 5 X 3 exercises mostly arms, chest and back.

I also went through about half of the first book in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0964479613/103-9315480-5163064?v=glance&amp;n=283155" target="_blank" title="Learntoplaygo">learning to play Go</a> series from <a href="http://www.samarkand.net/" target="_blank" title="JaniceKim">Janice Kim</a> &amp; Jeong Soo-hyun.   I have to say this is the most clear introduction I have ever read.  I have read the <a href="http://playgo.to/interactive/" target="_blank" title="WayofGo">interactive way of go</a>, and a <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?BeginnerStudySection" target="_blank" title="SenseiWiki">few</a> <a href="http://gobase.org/studying/rules/?id=0&amp;ln=uk" target="_blank" title="Gobase">other</a> <a href="http://go.kestrel.nu/?adwords=true" target="_blank" title="TipsForGo">resources</a>, however none have been so easy to follow.  I can be dense sometimes and I have to say just the intro chapters to the basic tactics is more than I ever got from the previous readings.  I also like how they use both Korean and Japanese terminology with explainations for the various parts of the game, which I have found elsewhere, however never really in a good manor.  I have yet to play through a full game, however I believe I will be doing that tonight. By full game, I mean a complete 19X19 board.  I have played countless 9X9 and resently started playing the 13X13 boards on my Pocket GnuGo.

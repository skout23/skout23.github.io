Ok!  So I look back at 2005 and I know that I got a lot accomplished; bought a house, did some good money stuff, got a shredder and crushed ice in my fridge, but I want to have a more structured approach to the coming 349 days.  Here is a short list of interests that I want to be more involved in.  Which means I need to make time for them.

Ok Enron is in Ch 11. I have paid off Vanderbilt completly. I am in pain
from kung fu on Sunday. I have absolutly no will power when it comes to
cleaning my apartment. I got a dreamcast and now want games to play for
said dreamcast. Christmas is approaching faster than ever. I have bought
2 gifts. I need to send the Vermont Chrisco’s gifts soon. Hmm I wonder
if anyone would like a family website. time to drink more water. I am up
to a gallon a day and it is great. I don’t drink soda’s that often, I
did however just buy a case of root beer. Along with like a ton of food.
time to stop procrastinating. work calls.

Well, I cant deny that I have yet to update about the trip.  Overall it was a good trip, however from the start I didn't know that the VT folks were coming in on Saturday.  I might have stayed in SA longer, than oh an hour for lunch.  Would not have rushed so fast to get there.  Had a great time had not seen Zach since I was maybe 14.

We played some chess, and I played abysmally, yet lucked out and pulled a win as black.  I think I messed up my opening.  i had meant to play a kings Indian defense, however think I transposed a reverse kings Indian attack for black.  with just random junk thrown in as well.  I was able to see the moves a little better than Zach at one key point at which he didn't realize that he could have won.  Well again what can i say I gave up too many pieces and got lucky in the end.

We played scrabble, I am terrible at spelling.  Not because I had bad teachers or the opportunity to learn.  Just has never been an important issue for me.  I always say that is what F7 is for.

Got to hang out with Family and overall had a great time.

OK so Work has been kicking my butt as of late,  mostly be cause I tend to procrastinate..(him I think I found another item to add to my list).  I think I have just been too scatterbrained this week.  Not enough sleep to keep concentration going.  Plus work is not fun..well OK work is fun, documentation blows.

I have been dragged back in to playing <a title="WoW" target="_blank" href="http://worldofwarcraft.com/">WoW</a>, which can ravish all your free time like no ones business.   Yet I have found an interesting outlet which allows for me to continue to explore the programming aspects of my goals, while also playing a fun game.  You can program the hell out of this game.  From simple custom macros, small scripts, to full on GUI add-ons all written a scripting language <a title="LUA" href="http://www.lua.org/">LUA</a>.  Now I know exactly nothing about lua other than it exists and is a scripting language, however I did pick up a <a title="book" href="http://urlx.org/amazon.com/a424">book</a> at halfprice which talks about Python, Ruby and Lua in regards to game programming fun!

Pretty close to leaving for the shmoo, am getting excited.  I love to travel when it is not mandatory.  However I think most people are that way, so I am not alone on this.

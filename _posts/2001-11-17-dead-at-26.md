Thats right! I am officially dead right now… Well at least dead tired. I
had a pretty easy workout last night, but today at the 4:30 workout I
was put to rest. I slept in and had some very vivid dreams. Got up and
watched “oh brother where art thou” great movie I got some cereal and
headed out to workout. started out with streaches and then went to run
about 3 miles. Ego made me kill myself on the run. Have to do something
about that. Then we went for another 2 hours working forms and I started
to learn another Gong fu chaun (yet another butcher job i am sure.)
Brandon one of the older students lead us. In under two hours we learned
almost all of it. There are some moves in the form i can not perform yet
which irks the heck out of me.

Well I am sure all that have read this must have by now known about
the US starting and finishing the War with IRAQ in record time , or
at least devistaing iraq into an 3rd world status in under 8 hours.
Strangly enough I feel apathetic to the whole matter, and would rather
not think about it anymore.  I am going with Christine to a concert tonight.
I will try and update this more in the coming weeks.

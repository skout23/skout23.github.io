Well this was the first time I went to owlcon as a guest/con-goer rather than a coordinator of some sort.  It is a lot easier to be a guest, I played a game of <a title="Firefly" target="_blank" href="http://www.margaretweis.com/">Firefly</a> RPG, as <a title="Wash" target="_blank" href="http://www.fireflywiki.org/Firefly/Wash">Wash</a>.  I then played, and eventually won my round of master maze D&D 3.5.  There was a team of rogue types, against a team of mages.  I tend to lean towards the caster types so I ended up on the caster team.  I played a Lawful Evil Drow 8th level Necromancer (Wizard).  I was basically the tanks for my party of mages.  I was surprised to win the first round.  I can only guess on how I did the second round the following day.  It was fun to play some table top again.

Everything is as it is. It has no name other than the name we give it. It
is we who call it something; we give it a value. We say this thing is
good or it's bad, but in itself, the thing is only as it is. It's not
absolute; it's just as it is. People are just as they are.

-Ajahn Sumedho, "The Mind and the Way"

Thought this was a great quote.  That is all.  will probly write more
later.  I feel I am in a journaling mood now.

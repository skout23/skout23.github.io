Well I have started to transition into a programming role, while still performing my security related duties on various projects.  To be honest I am ecstatic about the possibilities!  Let me start acting like a programmer then :)  I think I will offer some un-informed opinions on IDE's and see if anyone notices.  In just a few hours of poking around (about 8 hours of working with Eclipse 3.1 &amp; about 2 hours in Netbeans 5.5 beta 2) I think that netbeans is a bit more polished and more well formed than Eclipse.  I think both are great IDE's, but think I will be trying to focus on using Netbeans.

Otherwise I have been pulled back in to the fold of EOTL, and will have to ween myself away over the next month or so.  I expect that if one of my majors dies then it will be an abrupt departure again.  For now the mud is vibrant again, or at least I am delusional enough to make myself believe that.

I have been working out more often, and am in better shape than before the summer.  Will possibly outline some stuff that I have been doing in that regard here at a later date.

Reading wise I have been sorta catching up on my books, I still have yet to finish the Baroque Cycle, still about 30% done with the last book.  I have moved on and read a few books to get back in the mood... Sparrow and the 4th book in the Fire and Ice series.  Also have been slowly reading "the Watchmen" graphic novel.

I have been traveling a bunch as of late: most recently in NYC.  I think if I had the chance I would move there in an instant, Got to live on the Island though.  before that was in DC, Austin... and I am heading to San Fran and then FL here shortly.

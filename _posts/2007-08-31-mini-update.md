Picked up an apple keyboard today at lunch and was able to initiate a fresh install.... will write more when I get home and finish.

So I must not have selected the right options earlier... ended up with just a re-install over the existing install, rather than a new install.. but figured out how to do what I wanted... I decided I wanted a fresh install.  So started over on the install.  Still not completely working with the whole keyboard combos at boot time.  Will play around with that later.  Right now I am installing a fairly small(ha!) amount of packages, which I think is still over 4g.  Of note I got rid of the extra langs, all the i* suites except iMovie &amp; iDVD, and I added X11 with plans to install Macports &amp; Xcode as well.  Also found my textmate license so will play around with that later as well.  Want to get a nice ruby and python dev environment going.  If nothing else openssh &amp; vim should be no problems.

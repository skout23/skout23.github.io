Well not really. I just think people should be more informed, and more
active. I want more visibility into what is going on in my Government.
That’s why I really am excited about websites such as the Sunlight
Foundation, and Open Congress: [Sunlight][][OpenCongresss][] Which is
why I support this “pledge site”, [Change Congress][]. I really enjoy
the colored map depicting the “sludge”: Okay getting off my soap box.

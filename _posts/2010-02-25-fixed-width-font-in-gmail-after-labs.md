title: Fixed Width Font in gmail after labs
category:

I am a fan of the [google labs][1].  Gmail labs in particular is a fav of
mine, since I tend to use gmail a bunch. In a gmail dev [blog post][2] I
read this morning, I saw that google had decided to retire some of the lab
feature. The list of "graduated" and "retired" can be found on the post.
What irked me at the time, was the "retirement" of Fixed Width Fonts.  
So I [fixed][4] it.

I had just only recently started to use this  feature and was initially pissed.
I then followed links to get to the [feedback][3] form, intending to give them
a pleading letter of objection.  I then started reading the posts in the
[Fixed Font][4] threads. There I found a greasemonkey to perform the Font switch
without the need of the labs.  Long story short, Chromium supports greasemonkey
scripts, I modified the script to match Chrome's standards and it works well
for me YMMV.  You can find the script at the [gambit files][4] repo. You can install 
directly from the page, or download and mess with it yourself, and then later
install it.

apricot and pineapple pure preserves? who would have thought.  Had a
great workout last night.  Very quick but got the blood pumping.  I did
not have a lot of time to warm up.  did the shibashu as a class and then the
first 4 forms and then a quick hard cool down.  I am still not in a good
shape.  I have started to curtail my intake of calories, I found I was
over 200 again last week.  I was back down to 195 yesterday and hope to
get down to about 185 and see where I am at when that happens.  It
suprises me how quickly I forget my dreams.  This morning I was not out of
bed 2 mins and had completely forgotten what I had been dreaming about.
I will tell myself to remember my dreams for a while and start writing
them down.  ok back to work for a while.  I may write more tonight or later.

Well tonight I did some research about the Monks I take kung fu from.  Man they are some very cool people
I suggest to anyone to come by the temple and check it out.  lots of fun.  They don't speak very much
english but man they are very funny, always joking with big smiles.  When they are training you... they
can be very serious, but it is by far the best time i have had working out.  Here are a couple links:

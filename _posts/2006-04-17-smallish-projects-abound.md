I am updating the site a little, with some blog links.  Going to try and create a meta forums site, for my own personal use, think lots of RSS related to hacker forums.

Just got back this morning at 4:30am from the San Angelo trip, saw my cousin Zach, uncle Frank, and aunt Ingrid.  I will write more about the trip and other stuff later tonight.

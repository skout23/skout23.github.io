I played way too much matt hoffmanâ€™s pro bmx last night. I kept dreaming
about doing bike tricks. weird! I was really hungry when lunch started
today. Surprisingly hungry. I had a gyro over at Rachels, a nice little
sandwich shop Stephan Puffer introduced me to. Sorta in limbo about the
HSTW. There is no direction and I have done the part that I am
interested in. I had a pretty stiff workout on Wed. Colin M is still
visiting. We are trying to get tickets to the nutcracker tonight, Colin
will be heading out to Cali on Saturday at 2pm. That does not jive well
with my plans to go shopping for cars that day. We will have to wait and
see.

Haaaaaapy birthday to meeeeee.  Happy Birthday to me...and many moooore.
OK very cool things happened yesterday.  It was a bit frustrating
yesterday working with MAC's and SWITCH ports.  I am used to working
in the abstact ip's and above.  I got out of work at a little after
6pm and then headed to kungfu.  I was asked my Shi De Shan to make/create
the Shaolin Temple's website, and I have a secret that I can't tell.
I might put links here with the site once I get the framework in place.
I believe today I will start reading the new Robert Jordan book finally
after nearly a year of having it.  I will be having dinner with Mom tonight.
Not sure what to eat.

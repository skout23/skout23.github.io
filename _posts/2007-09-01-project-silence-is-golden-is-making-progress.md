So I don't know what was up with the generic keyboard stuff yesterday.  I am really digging the new keyboard so blah, not going to worry about it at this point.  I currently have the mac to never suspend, 10 mins video suspend, never spin down the hdd.  I have installed vmware fusion, and created a vmwareuser account with is now the default login, I have startup login items for the vmware user that starts up my vm's, and then switches out of the vmwareusers display to the user/passwd screen.  Yes I know this is a security risk since anyone with physical access can just shift out of the startups and have full access, but its the size of a tiny lunchbox, and if they have that kind of access already, they  can just take it.

I have Arch linux running smoothly in vmware atm... I am a bit concerned with the current 256M for my vm, but will up it to 512 or more when I upgrade the macs memory 1G just seems small now, :)

I need to rummage through the 1.6T of data I have laying about all over the place and try to cut it down.  Way too much stuff, which I doubt I will ever get a chance to invest any quality time reviewing.  I dont see the need to have more than 20G of data on my server at any time.  I think I have about 300G of random stuff on my old server which I want to migrate to a external HDD, and my old XP desktop *the gaming machine*, I am thinking I might still keep it around since I don't boot it up that much and never keep it running.  Will have to give it some thought... kinda depends on how well the mac mini can game.  So over all, I think the mac mini will work for a light desktop (possibly even gaming), and vm server,   My next project is to get bootcamp and XP installed... but it can wait.

OSX wise I have bootcamp, macports, X11, Xcode, textmate, and firefox installed, however only firefox is halfway configured.

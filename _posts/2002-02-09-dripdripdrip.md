Time is going very slowly tonight.  I am at the first night of the
graveyard shift period.  So far it is pretty cool.  I got to sleep
most of the day away and now get to play.  I have very little
worry about anything breaking.  I will be doing some introspection
later tonight but for now I will be playing games, and watching
videos.

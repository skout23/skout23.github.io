So I have plans on attending <a title="Shmoocon" target="_blank" href="http://www.shmoocon.org/">shmoocon</a> again.  Last year was great and I was about 2 seconds away from winning the hacker/halo (hacking part) contest.   However before I can safely get out the door and have fun.  I need to finish some paper work.  Will be headin there with a friend unlike last year were I had to break out on friday night and head over to a clients office to install some gear.  I am looking forward, as always to Dan Kaminsky, he is  great  presenter.   Very lively, when not a day out of ICU.  Local Patrick Stach looks to have a good talk, I left my sweater at his house over a year ago.  There are a couple time slots where I will have to have my friend split and record so we can both benefit.  I wonder if they are going to have the hackers on the town type event again.

I don't care how carefree/lax/lazy/easy-going you are.  Build a schedule and stick to it.  It makes your life a lot more managable, as well you get more from it.  Now of course I don't really have what could be discribed as a "schedule" for what I do daily.  I have two modes which I like to call "normal mode" and "OMG I have to get this done" mode.  So do as I suggest rather than what I do.  Tools to help build a schedule.. there are a bunch of "AJAX" based tools.  I might build one, or implement one for myself.  I am just going to think about it for now.  A good old todo list within Outlook or a simple txt file will work for now.

What can I say... Not a lot happening.  Karen is going to go visit
her sister, Kathyrn (who is uber cool i might say) and I am not even
kissing up.  Karen will be gone, I will be bored out of my mind, I am
sure.  Karen says she has a book to keep me busy, but I don\'t know...
she said she will be back on the 8th.  So here is hoping.

Another night of absolutly nothing happening.  I am however wide awake.
So i might just head on over to the temple for a workout.  This morning.
I have been trying to learn C via the KnR book, plus some notes and
then reading other sources when I get confused.  This can be a slow
process.  I still am at a loss as to if I should go with C or C++ first.  who knows.

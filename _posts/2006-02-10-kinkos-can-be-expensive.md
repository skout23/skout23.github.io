If you are trying to print large color documents.  We had a document which was about 160 pages front and back, which needed to be printed in color and then bound.   We needed to produce 3 of these, to print and bind these documents in the store, it would cost five hundred and ninety one dollars and some change, however by printing them out in the office and then bringing them in only to be bound.  The cost was only sixteen dollars and some change.  Quite a diff I would say.  I know this is totally boring, however is most present in my mind.

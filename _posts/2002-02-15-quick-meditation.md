the exercise for centering oneself is a simple one.  Stop thinking of
what you intend to do.  Stop thinking of what you have just done. Then,
stop thinking that you have stopped thinking those things.  Then you
will find the Now, the time that stretches eternal, and is really
the only time there is.  Then, in that place you will finally
have the time to be yourself.

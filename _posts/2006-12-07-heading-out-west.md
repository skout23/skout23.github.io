<p class="MsoNormal">Hey all,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Just wanted to let everyone know that I have some big news, I will be moving to sunny California, home of earthquakes, floods, mudslides, wild fires, riots, and Hollywood.  I will be making the move over the next few months, but my new job starts up the 2<sup>nd</sup> week of January.  I have just yesterday accepted an offer from a company in Santa Monica, CA to perform the duties of Sr Linux Guru, and all around slacker.  It was a great run in Houston, but I really needed a change.  Now donâ€™t fret, I will be visiting relatively often, as I have close family ties in Houston, and the best friends a guy could ask for.  I will be keeping my house as well, and renting it out at least for the foreseeable future.  If anyone is interested hit me up with an email, currently I have one person who is possibly going to move in and have one of the three bedrooms, but am still short of what I want to cover the mortgage. Otherwise I just wanted to share in my excitement.</p>

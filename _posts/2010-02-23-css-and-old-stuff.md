I learned a little bit about [markdown][1], [css][2], and took
a quick [stab][3] at an export of old posts.  My script was based
off of [swenson's][4].

~ At somepoint I used hpricot to parse the xml
since I was having issues with sequel, but I am not sure why used
hpricot instead of nokogiri. It was early 2009 when I last attempted 
the blog migration, what can I say it was a different time.
Will be cleaning the layout more in the coming days.

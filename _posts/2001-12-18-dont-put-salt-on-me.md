I feel sluggish.  I had an barely good workout last night, and that is only
because of my cooldown.  Colin has a date with the lawyer at 5:30pm on
Thurs, and a court date on Friday at 8am.  Not sure what to think about
that.  All things remaining sane Colin will be on the train come noon,
and I can go to Ballenger on the 23rd.  I need to catchup on my shopping.
LIKE NOW!  Still not sure what people will want.  Have to wait and see.
I guess.  I have been reading <a href="http://wilwheaton.net">wilwheaton.net</a> a lot.
It is pretty good, just I can't seem to figure out if it is some form of
star worship or something.  who knows.

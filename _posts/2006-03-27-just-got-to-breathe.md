I feel the presure mounting, something behind me, waiting.  I know it is just myself, but feels like more.  Today is Terrentino's birthday, who knew.  I had an boring weekend, I was alseep more than 30 hours of it at least.  Other times I was fading in and out of sleep, urging the dreams to come. I need more.

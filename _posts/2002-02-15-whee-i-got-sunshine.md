I was moved to a new cube tonight.  I now have a window seat.
This is pretty cool since I am very much lacking in the sunshine
dept.  Not much going on! I moved all the computers and cleaned
my desk.  I am sorta ready to get the day started heh if that
makes any sense.  I am very tempted to just not go to sleep and then
go to bed early tonight.  That way I will be ready when I need to
be back at work at like 5:30am Saturday.  ok well I am going to
go to sleep.  bah to the staying up idea.  I will get up at 1pm
and then call my mom, about the court docs.

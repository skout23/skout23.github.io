<p>OK, going to not drink sodas for a while.  I didnt drink any soda for about 4 months last year, and I think I can at least 6 months this year.  This might not seem like much, but I am an admitted obsessive freak about <a href="http://www.dublindrpepper.com/">Dublin Dr Peppers</a>.  So one moring down.  Now just to make it the rest of the day. Rinse and Repeat.

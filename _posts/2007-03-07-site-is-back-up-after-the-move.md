Getting closed to settled in my new apartment, finally got my dish and internet setup.  Now I need to get a phone line or possibly VOIP.  Also need to finally do my taxes, among other loose ends I need to clean up.  Hope to have everything unpacked tonight, and at least half way through the laundry.  I have a bunch of admin work for the server I might put off until the weekend.  Shortly I will have a write-up for Xen SMP x86_64 on dom0/U mostly debian based, but should be easy enough to modify.  I am quite tempted to play around with WoW again... so who knows that might consume my hours here again shortly.  Will update again later with my thoughts on the process of moving.

I am starting up a pre New Years goal list.  Most of which involve cleaning
my Apartment, and keeping to my workout schedule.  I do have a long-term goal of
buying a House next year.  I am not sure what would be needed to actualize this.
However I am confident, that I will achieve my goal.

More to come later.

So I will be traveling a lot this coming week, San Fran on Sunday until Wed, then flying home for a short layover and back out again to Florida.   I have been trying to read "Head First Java", but work in the office is not allowing me much time to study.  This coming week should be more open for such things, as I will not have constantly deal with near hourly fires.  I do hope to get some sight seeing done as well.  When I was in NYC I didnt go sightseeing so much as I just walked around a bunch between the job and the hotel.  5th Ave, time square, empire state building, broadway, nyc public library, radio city music hall, various parks, and it goes on.  What was so strange to me is how close everything was.  It was all within like 2-3 miles.  So I walked to work a few times, and walked back a few times and got my gawking done.

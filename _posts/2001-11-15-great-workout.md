I had a great workout and will tell more later....
Ok it is later and that means I am to spill the beans on my workout.  I of course got to the
class about 6pm which is about 30-45 mins into the class.  They were just finishing streching,
and I got to do about 10 mins of them until we started the "Shibashu" ( I know I am butchering this.
Shi De Shan would watch us go across and then he would go after us and show the correct form.
I got a lot from his technique.  Went through a couple quan very slowly and then did them up front
of the class.
I presented the idea of the interview to Madonna and she and Shi De Shan wanted to review
Cyberkwoon first.  I can understand that.  We then started the second class, with running stairs.
After about 16 laps I started to feel some pain.  I cut out a little early.  I wanted to save my
strength for Saturday I plan on going all out on both classes at 10am and 4:30pm.  ok ttl

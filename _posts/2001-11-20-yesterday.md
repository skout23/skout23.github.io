I could hardly call it work. I went to kung fu after and went to the
competition forms class. Yet again I am reminded of how much i have yet
to learn. I was very happy with the splits I could do. Karen got back
from Arkansas on Sunday and has spent the last few days while not at
work cleaning her finds. I saw two that I really liked and have
separated them. I have recently started to drink like a gallon of water
a day. I am not sure if there are health risks for drinking too much
water. I am looking forward to Thanksgiving with my Grandparents I have
not seen them since July. I need to find out when I will be leaving work
on Wed so i can plan the trip. ok back to morning email.

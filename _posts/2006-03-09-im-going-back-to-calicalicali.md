naw I don't think so!

Okay back to the task at hand.  Well I just got back from my work trip up on Cali.  It was a lot of work, driving up in mountains, trying to be sneaky, oh and off-roading a rental jeep.  I have to admit it was a lot of fun.  Got to hang out with a crazy bunch of characters.  Got some documenting to finish for this part of the project, but for the most part, I was not needed.

I got to touch the pacific ocean, which is something I have not done in quite a long time ,I am guessing since at least 1986.  Had some sushi at "Ra", the sushi was not stellar, but the atmosphere of the restaurant was great.

Went out the first night and had a weird encounter with a local.  So myself and my colleague went to a local dive, and it was okay, I could tell he was wanting to mingle.  I am not a mangler by nature.  We moved to the outside to get a better view to just people watch.  We are outside for about twenty minutes when a typical "stoner" walks up and introduces me to a young black lady named I think Amanda.  I was unprepared for this and pretty much just sat there dumbfounded for about 10 seconds as I fumble with handshakes and greetings.  The stoner assures me he is just trying to "hook me up", at this point I turn back to my co-worker and laugh it off.  Stoner and "Amanda" retire back to the stones next to the fire.  I hope I did not offend them too much, with my blabbering.

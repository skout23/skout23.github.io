Well I completed the import of my old journal into the new wordpress site.  Feel free to browse my past.  Mostly boring and sporatic at best.  I think if I have this as my start page It will see more attention in the coming months.  Who knows though.  I did my taxes on Feb 2nd, I know such a procrastinator.  Owlcon is this weekend.  Think it might be strange to attend the con without being a coordinator.  I spent the better part of yesterday in various court systems of Houston, and Harris County.  Just take my advice and don't get tickets.

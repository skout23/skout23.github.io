My server has a bunch of access logs, however they are all sorta smooshed into one.  I will be updating all those vhosts and separtating out the logs here shortly.  I will find that nagging xml file I swear.

I was not feeling all that well this weekend, and ended up not doing much.  I have started to get back in to / start over with GO.  Tonight is HTA and I am looking forward to that.

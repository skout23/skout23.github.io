Last night at about 15 minutes of midnight Ned, a person I had just met, bursts into song.  He starts singing "Mad World", and it hits me.  It was a year ago(yesterday) that a friend of mine Darwin passed.  I know that amongst the motley crew that I call friends, there was a lot of mixed feelings concerning Darwin and his life style, and I don't apologize for him or what he had done in the past.  I just know that he was a person that seemed to live a full life, and I always saw a great potential in him.  Darwin had a toast, that I always heard him say at least once when ever we would go out...

There are good ships,
and there are wood ships,
The ships that sail the sea.
But the best ships, are friendships,
And may they always be.

Darwin, my friend, you are missed.

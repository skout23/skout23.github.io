HA! one of my fav lunch spots was on CNN tonight at like 4am.
I am starting to really like wine.  Mostly Chianti.  I like Ruffino
Riserva Ducale and Shiraz Chianti.  Both are very smooth.  I can't
believe how easy it is for me to be distracted.  I was sick today.
I will be going on a graveyard shift tonight.  I guess more civ3
will be order.

I am back at work, had a great time at the GPs house and had a wonderful
Christmas.  I got tons of candy and got to hang with my familiy and
got 2 more people addicted to Civ! heh.  The rental car was a great idea.
It was a comfort knowing that the car was not going to break down.
I made it back in great time.  We left San Angelo at like
4:30pm and
picked Tyler up in Ballinger and were back on the road at 5:17pm.  We hit
Austin just after 8pm, and were in Houston and dropping people off at
10:38pm, that is also stopping for fireworks for like 15 mins just
outside of Austin.  Michael played Civ3 for a bunch while we were drivin.
Tyler slept most of the way and I zoned.

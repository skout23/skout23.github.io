I have taken it upon myself to go back and learn c++, and to help me
with this I am going to start programming games again.  I found it
enjoyable back in the day when I was mudding, hopefully this will
keep me on track.  I slept good last night.  wierd dreams
but good.<br />
I fell asleep reading a book on C++ and man it is funny how easy it is
get to sleep with that and a laptop on my chest.

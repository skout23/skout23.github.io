I am very motivated as of late about certain stuff, however other stuff is falling behind.  For example, I am highly motivated about the CTF stuff, and all security related issues regarding that, however have had the hardest time waking up in the mornings for my workouts.  I resolve to workout everyday for until Monday.  I am writing it down so that I may be more motivated to act on my goals.

CTF opened earlier this week, quals are June 9th.  The due date of Erin and Josh's baby.  I am both nervous and terribly actious to get started with this.  I have very high hopes for our team.

I have started to take this energy supplement hydroxycut, which has me on edge a lot.  It feels like when I used to take 5 shots of expresso in my frapaccinos sorta fun, but hella nervous.  I notice my impatience more too.  What is weirder is that I have my alarm wake me at 4:45am and I take some then and again at about 9:30-10am.  But never after 1pm.  I think I would be way too wired if I were to do that.  I am staggering the intake a bit so as to not become reliant on them.

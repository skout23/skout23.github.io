I am pretty certain most of my few readers know about Child's Play from my past posts or emails, if not it is a charity from the folks over at <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com" title="PA">penny-arcade</a>.  This is the forth year, and I am bit surprised that I have not heard that much about it on PA, but saw a post about it today so thought I would write my annual post about the great charity.

"Since 2003, we've set up and organized Child's Play, a game industry charity dedicated to improving the lives of children with toys and games in our network of over 40 hospitals worldwide. In four short years, you as a community have answered the call and come together to raise millions of dollars."

It's pretty simple, you go to the site, click on a hospital ( I picked 2 this year for a change ), shop for some toys/books/dvd's whatever peaks your interest at amazon, and then purchase, and it is shipped to the child's hospital you picked earlier.

I can't describe to you how cool it feels.  I highly recommend you try it for yourself.

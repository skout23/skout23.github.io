Happy Valentines!  I am messing around with getting eclipse working with github, and just sorting out what all the querks might be.  Still doing a bunch of Ruby stuff, it is my default goto when I need a tool.  However I keep being drawn to GoLang. (I still think it should be names Issue9). Cheers, and hopefully I won't wait another year before updating again.

I am procrastinating again.  This time just with cleaning.
things I need to do to update this box:
1. Apache/PHP/Perl/MySQL
2. Save DB struct an data
3. save /home partition
4. reinstall Snort
5. save Website centric backend scripts cron/Adob, et all
6. Possibly other peoples sites too.
Well I had a good time at class tonight.  My mind is nowhere near
this plane of exictance though.  My mind is way ahead of me waiting for who knows what!
I have no idea what is going to happen later today.

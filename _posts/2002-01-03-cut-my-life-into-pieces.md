title: Cut my life into pieces

pieces is such a wierd looking word!  I have come to realize that
too much of my life is spent avoiding conflict.  Not saying that conflict
is the cats meow, oh no.  Just I can\'t let it be the driving force
within my life any longer.  I need to analyze why this bothers me
so much.  I know I have problems with wanting to please everyone, and
wanting to "save" everyone. I am not sure which is the root and which
the symtom.  I know I can find out the reason for all this and from there
form a plan
of action.  It is just that I feel I need to act sooner rather than
later.  Again i must question my motive.  Am I trying to please someone
with these actions or is it something important to me?  Ok what would MY
reasons be for fixing this problem?
1. the ability to say NO and not feel guilty would be nice!
That alone should be enough.  But that does not resonate enough
for me,  lets try again
2. I dont like surpressing feelings of disgust.
Thats better.  I could feel anger when I was typing that too.
Ok back to another related problem I believe.  I have a habit of
procrastination... I can tell it stims from a want not to fail, thinking
that if I dont start I cant fail... I have tried to stop that in the past
and feel I am making strides with that issue.  Do i get a since of
selfworth from pleasing/helping/saving people?  Is that my main motivation?
Lets get back to avoidance of conflict.. I have overslept for events
rather than just decline them at the start.  WHY??? why cant I just
say "no thanks!  I would rather not"?  I will continue this later after
I remove my link to the journal. heh.

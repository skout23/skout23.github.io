Jeffrey A. Tucker, has a great post about how shaving cream is a crutch, that your face does not need.  Read it <a title="ShavingCreamRacket" href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/tucker/tucker65.html">here</a>.  For years I never used shaving cream, since I had a nice mounted mirror in my apartment shower.  When I moved into the house, I kept meaning to get a mirror for the shower however never seemed to be a high priority.  I miss the speed at which I could shower & shave and get all cleaned up in the morning with out the need for ceremony.  Pure water here I come.

I know that some of you may remember I ran a pure RSS based news aggregator, back before there was a term for what I was doing :P,  from 1999 - mid 2005 not including some downtime.  Well I plan on bring it back in some form, but I have yet to find a nice package that I feel comfortable with which fits my simple needs.  And my <a title="oldsite" href="http://www.skoutsec.org/Oldsite">oldsite</a> was just ugly I might get it back working here this weekend, but don't expect much.Â  I have an inkling that I may bring it back in the form of a Ruby project, thereby combining some goals.

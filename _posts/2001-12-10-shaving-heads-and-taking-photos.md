Man had a busy day. I shaved Colin M head today. We then went to a photo
shoot of Sophie’s familiy. Sophie is a friend of Colin\’s. Her father
works for the DOD in Germany and was named scott. Anne Mary was
Sophia\’s mom and Just was here husband. Colin went through 14 rolls
of film. Colin is a very intense person. He just graduated from Harvard
(Jealousy) and is always doing something. I admire his drive. I have
known him for about 3 years.

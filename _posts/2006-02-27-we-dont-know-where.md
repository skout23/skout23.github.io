I have been listening to the Garden State Soundtrack WAY too much.  Head down, nose to the grindstone, neck deep, up to my ears, can't think of another, with work.  Slept too much this weekend, and not really restful sleep, so bad all around.  Started to read the 3 book again in the Baroque Cycle.  However only got about 4 pages into it, when the lights went out.  Oh and I like the Iron and Wine version of "Such great heights" more so than the original synth-pop version by the Postal Service.  If you are not familiar with the song, there is an M&M's commercial all kaleidoscopic with the back-ground music is "Such Great Heights".

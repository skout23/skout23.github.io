I can not express how much I hate working with AT&T as our service
providure which they are doing a third party to bell atlantic.
Here is a brief ascii of the situation.

(faraway location)
       |
     router
       |
    csu/dsu
       |
 link to verizion
       |
 Verizon Network
       |
Verizon\'s LINK to ATT
       |
  ATT network
       |
link to local power
       |
    csu/dsu
       |
     router
       |

and all sorts of problems all over.

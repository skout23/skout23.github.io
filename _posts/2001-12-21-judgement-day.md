8:25 I call the laywer no answer
8:35 I call the laywer no answer
8:45 I call the laywer get lawyer and he says will be right up
9:15 docket is called no lawyer
9:23 Judge asks if Colin M is in court.  I state he is being held by INS
Judge says\" Ahhh he is a guest, ok\"

9:45 I notice the lawyer is now in the room.
10:00 the lawyer notices Colin is not here.
10:15 the lawyer notices me.
10:17 the lawyer approaches me, we talk and he tells me what the case against Colin is.

her for like the last 4 years.
10:20 Lawyer recommends getting an INS lawyer.
10:21 I state I don\'t want to spend any more money, and that All I am willing to do is ship his stuff
home.
10:23 I ask about the Bail money and if I am responceble, he shrugs it off and say nah
10:23.30 I don\'t believe him... we say goodbyes and he says he will try and find Colin.
10:38 I head to the bailbonds man and confirm my thoughts that I am still liable for the bail
if there is no show on Colin.

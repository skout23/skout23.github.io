I'm good enough, smart enough, and gosh darnit noone reads this :).  Actually it is a day before the Defcon CtF pre-quals and I am sorta on edge.  I have been cramming for this for nearly 2 months now.  And I can see the results, however still don't have confidence that I am ready.  I really need to do laundry tonight.  Just need to make it through this weekend.

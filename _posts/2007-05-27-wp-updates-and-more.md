So I recently have been reading about the overall lack of updating that is going on in the WP community, and I have event witnessed some pretty high-profile sites which are not at currently secure levels too.  So I wanted to make sure I was at the latest (which I am now), and also wanted to take this time to play with some interesting plugins.  I am playing around with SEO based plugins, such that will maybe get more traffic to my little spot of the net.  I will spend a few days poking around and write up some reviews.
